I learned that the best strategy would involve trying to win a few key battles (i.e. not all of them), loading to ensure victories in those battles, and that it would entail barely winning in the end; i.e. a small margin of victory. 

My first thought was to look at ways to lock up the highest-value castles. Winning the battles for the top 3 castles is 27 points, only 1 short of victory, so my approach involved throwing a lot of soldiers at the top 3, a chunk at a lower-value one, and deploying 1 soldier at the remaining ones (to win battles against zero soldiers). An example of this approach is 0-2-1-1-1-1-1-30-31-32. This wins against many strategies but fails against a simple one of 10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10-10. Loading up on one lower-value castle to 11 (to defeat that strategy) leads to too few soldiers at the higher-value castles.

Then I thought of the opposite approach; i.e. concede the battles for the 3 higher-value castles and try to win the remaining 7 (which would yield 28 points, and a win). The best approach I found was 11-11-11-11-11-19-26-0-0-0-. The 26 is necessary to defeat a strategy of deploying Œ_ of oneäó»s soldiers (i.e. 25) to each to the top 4 castles, the 11 is to beat the 10x10 strategy, and assigning the remaining 8 soldiers to the 5th highest castle.

This strategy works against almost every strategies, especially the ones that many people likely would choose. It fails against strategies involving loading up on the mid-value castles; e.g. 0-0-1-4-11-20-25-20-15-4. However, as those strategies lose to many other ones I thought people would not choose them."

Each castle i with a number of troops proportional to its value i.e. 100i/28. Using these two hypotheses, castles with highest values would have fewer troops than their values required (using the first axe). The best strategy would be then (using the second axe) to use a set a castle with sum values 28 and with the highest values possible. We end up then with using Castle 10,9,8 and 1 (sum is 28). Proportional allocation would be 36,32,28 and 4 (sum is 100)."

I spent the last three soldiers in the 8,9,and 10 castles to win if there were no soldiers from the other side.

So, I chose to attack every castle with at least one, but to focus on the lowest seven for a win (1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28).  I threw one person on castles 8-10, so if they are left undefended I have a chance of picking off a high value one.  But I have 97 points distributed on the lowest value seven.

Castle 10 isn't worth fighting seriously for, but at the same time, other people might agree. In theory, my wide deployment will help against people who focus heavily on high numbers.

I could incorporate ties in my strategy, but I'm an engineer, not a mathematician, it's late on a Friday afternoon, and I'm kind of tired. 28 points can be achieved through winning only four castles: 1, 8, 9, and 10. I concentrated all my forces on those four keeps. I split up my army to assail those keeps with a distribution of 3, 29, 31, and 37 warriors, respectively.

It is my personal opinion that people will either focus on getting the largest numbers to necessary (10, 9, 8 and then 1) to complete 28 points. The smallest numbers necessary (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) . The best strategy would then be to counteract these two. No matter the strategy, people will focus their forces on the largest numbers they go for. Therefore it is best to stay away from 10 and 7.

Using this strategy, I must win all my castles or the other person wins by default. But trying to win multiple ways is bad - pick a strategy and play it with all your might.  Other players that want to win with the 8 in the least number of castles will require 4 castles - they can't do it in 3.  Since winning with 4 castles requires at least a 9 or a 10, the 4 castle approach would rarely see that player put anything larger than 25 on the 8.

Well, it's topical.

There are 55 total points available. If one gets 28 he wins. If you put 3 on castle 1,  29 on 8, 32 on 9, and 36 on 10 you'll get there. You're allocating soldiers by castle points. 

But if you lose even the 1 castle, you lose.

Also, this strategy can be defeated by only 10 soldiers. 4 on castle 1, and 1 each on 2-7.

But it would beat my strategy. 

I went for efficiency. 1.8181... soldiers are available per point. If you allocate 14 soldiers to castle 8 there's virtually no waste of soldiers versus points. Approximately zero. It's efficient. 

But you have one soldier left. And where do you put him?

This is where it gets interesting. The best are, If I'm right, castles 10, 3, and 8.

In order, you're wasting 1 soldier for.555.... points for castle 10, or .6 soldiers for about 1 point for castle 3 and 8. 

But people like whole numbers up to six. Then they go for even numbers and multiples of 5. So adding the soldier to the 10 castle is probably not going to help. 

Also it's the least return. 

Between castles 3 and 8 I already have 5 soldiers attacking castle 3. But only 14 attacking castle 8. So I added the extra soldier there and thought that the worst that could happen is that I lose castle 3 and split castle 8 for a net gain of +1."

That's even. And only 99 soldiers. 

But for a minute let's consider the Electoral College approach. (Hey, it's topical.) There are 55 castle points available. 28 wins. So 3 on 1, 29 on 8, 32, on 9, and 36 on 10 is the most efficient to win 28 points. 

And beats my approach. 

But, interestingly, loses to only 10 soldiers. 4 on castle 1 and 1 soldier each for castles 2-7. The EC approach has to win EVERY castle it attacks. With even a tie it loses. 

So my question is what to do with my last lonely soldier? I've already overspent on castles 1,2,6, and 7. Those are out. I've underspent the same largest amount, .4, on castles 3 and 8. So adding my last soldier to one of those gives me the best benefit. But which one?

So now we get to the what is everyone else doing and how do people think territory. 

For 1-5 they use the number they need. For about 6-15 they use even numbers and multiples of 5. Someone might want 12 or 15 of something. Never 13. Or 17. 

Because you're getting into 15 or 20 territory now. 

And no one anywhere ever ordered  or bought 29 of anything. 

So adding to castle 3 moves me from 5-6. I'll take the probable draw because moving castle 8 to 15 soldiers even if I draw is more valuable. 

And moving castle 9 or 10 from 16 and 18 probably won't make a difference. "

2,4,5,7,9,11,13,14,16,19,"I attempted to pick values equivalent to the victories points value in making up 28 victory points. For example, winning castle 10 gives you 34.7% of the victory points needed to win a majority. The proportional percentage of this is about 18%.

2,4,5,5,3,3,4,4,32,38,"The deployment is based on a few key principles:

1. Have a set minimum number of troops for each castle
It pays to leave a few troops in each castle, even the lower valued ones. If an opponent leaves a castle empty (and it is likely that a decent chunk of opponents will do so in order to focus on higher-valued castles) then you can gain substantial points for a very small cost. The minimum is largely trial and error; I ended up with 3 as this was a good compromise between saving troops for larger castles and not getting easily defeated. I did not apply this minimum to Castle 1 as it would not be economic to do so - Castle 1 is worth so little that deploying more than 2 troops to it can quickly become a waste.

2. Fight hard for Castles 9 and 10
This should seem obvious, but if you can win both of these it makes your work a lot easier. On the other hand, if an opponent manages to beat you in these then they have barely any troops left, and thanks to your minimum you have a good chance of winning most of the rest.

2. Pay more attention to Castles 1-4 then 5-6
You can win Castles 1-4 fairly cheaply and get an easy 10 points. If you also win Castles 9 and 10 then you have easily won the war. On the other hand, if an opponent also focuses on 1-4, then the minimum should give you at least a few points in the middle. Combine with #2 and you have a decent shot.

3. Don't try to remain undefeated
No deployment is undefeatable. My deployment, for instance, loses to putting 10 soldiers in each castle, and also to the deployment 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19 (in Castles 1-10 respectively) which could be considered the ""mean"" deployment. Other submitters are unlikely to go with these deployments as they are overall quite weak - they are more likely to go with stronger options which nonetheless have vulnerabilities. One likely mistake is to heavily weight 3 Castles instead of 2 - you will not be able to put enough soldiers in each to beat a strong Castle 9 or 10, effectively wasting a larger amount of soldiers while also leaving less for the smaller castles. Remember, any path to victory requires at least 4 castles.

Through these principles and trial and error, I found this deployment to be the most successful, beating 22 other hypothetical deployments."
2,4,4,8,9,10,12,15,17,19,"Not knowing how my fellow Riddler readers will attack this problem, I went for the optimal strategy against a random distribution.

I was initially going to go for all of the lower castles, (7 and below) but that would lose whenever someone spent big on 10, 9, 8, and a random one. My goal here is to win castle 9 almost always, 7 almost always, and usually 6, 5, and 3 without conceding any other castles. Winning these castles would provide 30 points and a win. Losing one of them could be made up if someone sent zero soldiers to castles to some of the other castles.

1,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,"For this, I didn't try to get in the minds of my opponents. I developed a random deployment generator - or tried to. Then pitted each deployment against every other deployment. 

I first selected a random number from 1 to 10. This would be the first castle I would deploy troops to. I selected a random number from 0 to 100 to determine the number of troops. Then I selected another number from 1 to 10. If it was the same as the first draw, I drew again. Then selected the number of troops to send between 0 and 100 less the number at the first castle. Repeat this until all castles have been assigned troops. This produced a lot of identical deployments, which made me question the randomness of this. After further thought, I should chosen the second castle with a random number from 1 to 9. But because I'm up against a deadline, I don't have the time to develop truly random deployments. I can still glean some insights from my faux random deployments.

I got about 10,000 unique deployments and ran them against each other - round robin style. I added in a few of my own (e.g. even distribution, weighted high, weighted low, etc.) I gave 1 point for a win, 0 for a loss and 0.5 for a tie. 

The winning deployment earned 9,663.5 points and was one of my chosen strategies. This beat out the next best strategy (a random one) by almost 40 points. 

Honestly, I'm disappointed in this answer. I was hoping that one of the random ones would prove better. "

I only put down 1 member of my army on castle 1 as it of such little value that I do not feel it is worth the additional unit.  I figured many opponents would fight for castle 10, or put down a distributional amount on castle 9 and I wanted to ensure I could win a high value castle, so I choose castle 9. An aggressive, distributional player, would put 32 troops on castle 9, thus I put 33. Given I can no longer distribute proportionally, I took the troops away from castles 4 and 5, hoping my counterpart will attack aggressively on those castles, or not at all.

I decided the best course of action would be to optimize over the win/loss rate of a strategy against a set of random possible opposing strategies.  So I booted up R and ran a simulated annealing algorithm to create a strategy that seemed to win a lot.  That failed horribly because the set of all opposing strategies is enormous.  

So instead of trying out random opposing sets, I tried to create a smaller set of ""plausible"" opposing strategies (repeated or nearly-repeated values in 3-10 slots making up the bulk of the allocation, with random allocation to all other slots).

Towers 8-10 leave you one point short, so you can try to take the #7 or drop all the way to trying to sneak the #1. You can try to abandon the high numbers and just take #1-7. I thought of some sneaky in between answers, like taking towers #4-8. Generally the top heavy strategies worked well. Any strategy that focused more troops on the bigger towers did better than those that divvied out the troops equally.

This final strategy of focusing on the even towers ended up winning the mini battle-royale. I suppose the point is to win the 10, while conceding the 9, win the 8 , while conceding the seven, and so on, netting just enough points to win with a little room to spare. I made sure to get at least one troop to each tower to sneak wins against folks who focus too heavily. I massaged some of the totals to keep them above any product of 5 (11, 21, 26...).

However, I found that an opponent that put 10 on each would win against this strategy.  I considered a strategy that would win me castles 1 through 7 (also totaling 28 points) but that started spreading my troops too thin making it likely that an opponent would place more than me on just one castle which would cause me to lose.  I started to realize that it is not wise to put zero soldiers at a castle; even putting just one soldier at a castle could help me win in cases where my opponent left castles unattended (which I figured would happen often).

I looked at optimal strategies for smaller versions of the game.  For 9 soldiers and 3 castles, [0,0,9] is an optimal strategy.  For 16 soldiers and 4 castles it is already difficult to find an exact solution.  Solving it approximately by using the fictitious play method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_play), shows higher coefficients placed on strategies with more soldiers on the higher points castles, but not all on the highest point castle.  This makes intuitive sense because the higher points castles are more valuable, but you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket because the other castles combined are worth more than any one castle.

Therefore I chose a strategy where deployments to each castle were approximately proportional to the point value of the castle.  This is as reasonable a strategy as any, given that no pure strategy is optimal."

Initially, I split my pool of 100 into four groups of 25 troops each for castles four, seven, eight, and nine, but decided to reduce the count at castle four by five troops and castle seven by one troop, sending one troop to each of the remaining six castles in case my opponent's plan had similar roots to mine and used dense placement at a few castles and sparse to no placement elsewhere.

The higher value towers are worth the most, but getting two lower towers will more often than not, net more value- 10 is equal or worth more than 1/2 of the tower value combinations, 9 is worth less than 1/2 of the combined pairings and so on.

1,1,1,2,2,6,26,26,19,16,Since you need at least 28 points to win the war to win with the minimum number of castles you need to win 4 castles all of which are 6 points or higher. Knowing that distributed troops to beat most deployments that split troops evenly across 4 castles as well as to beat other potentially common distributions. Put some troops in lower value castles to try to reduce likelihood of splitting points in those areas reducing the likelihood of losing one higher point castle leading to losing the war.
1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,42,45,"The Monarch of Riddler Nation will be the player who wins the most match-ups - only victory and defeat matter, not average scores. A winning strategy will be one that maximizes the number of (often very narrow) victories.

Therefore, one could do very well by concentrating all troops evenly among any combination of four castles (25 soldiers per castle) that together yield 28 or more victory points. There are 27 such combinations, all of which win against anyone who tries to spread troops more thinly among all 10 castles (e.g. [1,1,1,1,1,1,23,23,24,24]). The dominant strategy among these is [0,0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25], which defeats any other 4 x 25 combination (e.g. [0,0,0,25,0,25,0,25,0,25]).

I think enough people will start with a variation on 4 x 25 that it is the strategy to beat. The only successful counter involves piling more than 25 soldiers into a single castle, at the expense of potentially conceding another castle. How does one beat [0,0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25]? Easy! [0,0,0,0,0,0,24,25,25,26]!
Or better yet, [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,33,34]! And how does one beat that? [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,50]! But wait, that could be defeated by [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,100]!

If we take this to its logical extreme, the equilibrium strategy is to pile all soldiers into the highest value castle. This is because any strategy contesting a certain set of castles can be outdone by another that contests the most valuable of these castles *harder* at the expense of any single less valuable castle.

However, will this actually be successful in reality? I highly doubt it. An iterated series of matches between two opponents might very well result in this strategy being used, if only for a brief moment. Opponents stack troops in the 4 most important castles until one realizes targeting only the top 3 is even better, and so on until only the 10 victory point castle is contested. But this strategy would immediately be handily beaten (45-10) in the next round by an opponent who suddenly decides to send soldiers to all castles again.

Just like in the Keynesian Beauty Contest problem, most players will not take this game to its logical extreme. Here, anyone who contests only castle 10 will probably lose the vast majority of their contests. They will only beat those who contest a set of other castles with a combined value less than 10, which I think will be rather rare.

I think it's quite likely that most contestants will invest heavily in 3 or 4 castles. Stacking an absurd amount of soldiers in castles 9 and 10 can defeat most such strategies by snatching 19 victory points right off the bat, with hopefully enough VP coming to me from ties or narrow victories at lower VP castles.

This leaves me very vulnerable to very basic strategies (e.g. 10 soldiers per castle, or random placement) or to those that stack a minimum of 3 or 4 soldiers per castle, but I am hoping the presumed preponderance of 4 x 25 type strategies will scare people off from these types of even spreads.

If the enemy also sends a token troop to every castle I still gain 13.5 points, within half a point of compensating for the total loss of any two of my must-win castles except for both 8 and 9.

My choices were based on the competition for 10, 9 and 8. I found that 10 is probably the most cost effective castle to win, but will also be heavily contested. Most would allocate either way too many points to this castle and leave others unguarded, or would allocate less than the optimal rate (rounded up) + 1. 9 and 8 are also essential to victory for a minimum castle set (4 castles, adding up to 28 or more), but without 10, require 2 more castles. I decided to avoid 8 and 9 based on the fact that if they wanted 10, they might also want 8 and 9. So instead, I focused my troops on  5, 6 and 7 to achieve my minimum of 28. 

I assumed that other players would either ignore the castles they did not want, in favor of the castles they did want, or they would allocate a minimum of 1 troop as well, in which there would be no point advantage to the castles they did not want.

(1) Win in at any unchallenged castle (i.e. at least 1 soldier to every castle... the pawns muahaha). 

(2) Counteract what I believe are high probability strategies (like at least 1 on every one [ha!], 10 evenly distributed throughout all, or heavy fights for 9 and 10)

As a law student, my strengths aren't math, but I did my best to figure the initial likelihoods of soldier distribution and adjust accordingly to evidence (just for example, I assume initially I'm going to lose the 10 castle 99% of the time, .9% of time I'll split it with someone, and .1% of time I'll win it; there's some hope that your saavy readers do the math and maybe put only 1 in that category b/c they assume like I do it's a lost cause but that they can't just toss it, putting 1, which increases probability that 8 or 9 is a battle ground).

There are lots of ways to getting to 28.1+2+3+...+6=21 so you need at least castle 7 to win. This also means you are guaranteed to win with 7 castles. 10+9+8=27, so you need to win at least 4 castles as well. If you are only going to use 4 castles, you need castle 9 and/or castle 10 because 8+7+6+5=26.

My first strategy was to have at least one soldier go to each castle. That way if my opponent decides to only attack 4 castles, I am guaranteed 6.

My second strategy was to try to win with only 4 castles.  Since you need either castle 9 or 10, I figured they would be the most desired and soldiers would be sent accordingly. So instead of guarding both,  I decided to pick one. I decided to go with castle 9 and not 10. After that,  my options if I wanted only 4 castles were either castles 4, 7, 8, and 9 or castles 5, 6, 8, and 9. I went with the latter so I wouldn't have to win 7, 8, and 9.

Once I chose my 4 castles, I had 90 soldiers left to play with and sent them by weight.  40 more to castle 9, 30 more to castle 8, and 10 more to both castles 5 and 6. I put 10 more in those csdtles, in case someone just put 10 in each castle."

One needs to capture a minimum of 4 castles to achieve this, so this caused me to focus my troops on the four castles that would in my mind be most effective in achieving this. 

By giving up castle 10, it does not make any sense to pursue castles 1-4: their values are equal and it would be a waste of troops to capture one only for the other to offset the gain. To me, the only castles that matter are 5-9. Thus, I deployed troops in the way to most likely take the higher value targets while also hopefully overpowering the lower priority castles with troops gained by sending the bare minimum to half of the castles.

I remove some from 6, allocating a few extra to the high end and one to each of the low five, so to beat strategies that place zero on many castles.

General design: started with 10,000 randomly allocated rows allocating soldiers in groups of 5 (to get improved clustering), plus ten seed rows, including 100 in castle 10, 50/50, 10/30/30/30, 25/25/25/25, 20/20/20/20/20, and 16/16/17/17/17/17 (castle 10 always the last number) and several others.  Simulated all deployments battling all others, then tallied wins, and created a new sample of 20k rows using PPS with replacement sampling based on the square of wins.  Reran the simulated battles, then did another sample selection step with 25k rows again using PPS, and reran those simulated battles.  The winner was 19/19/20/21/21 which won 23,812 battles out of 25,000.

I also confirmed the results using a OLS regression with the ten castle quantities as independent variables and wins as the dependent variable.  OLS indicates that castles 7 through 10 have positive coefficients, 6 has approximately 0 coefficient, and 1-5 have negative coefficients, suggesting that more tests might pull towards a higher number for castle 9 and 10.  Given the slightly negative (but nearly zero) weight on 6, I felt confident removing some of the armies from it in order to put single armies on the other five."

I have been considering 3 broad classes of strategy.  (Obviously there are deployments which don't fit into this schema, but which may still be meritorious.) I call these classes Paper, Scissors and Stone.

Paper strategies cover all the castles with forces approximately proportional to the value of the castle, for example (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,  13, 15, 17, 19).  I also consider an equal distribution of forces, 10 to each castle, to be a Paper deployment.

Scissors surgically target a winning subset of castles, for example (10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 30, 30,. 30).  Clearly Scissors will defeat paper.

Stone strategies target subset of castles insufficient to win on their own, but additionally hope to win or tie enough other castles to gain the extra points to win the war. (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 32, 32, 32) is a stone strategy.  It will win if it wins castles 8, 9, and 10 and either wins castle 1 or ties any other castle.

Stone loses to paper (it wins its targeted castles but loses the rest).  It mostly wins against scissors because both strategies are likely to contest at least one high-value castle, and stone's forces will be more concentrated.

It's my expectation that the majority of depoyments submitted will be Scissors or paper-scissors hybrids.  My original idea was the stone (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 33, 33, 33)  This is elegant in that it wins precisely when it wins castles 8, 9, and 10, and any other castle is uncontested by the opponent.  The first condition is nearly certain against a scissor strategy since these must target at least four castles, and it will be very difficult to commit as many as 33 soldiers to any one of them.  The second condition is much less certain.  I cannot predict how many competitors will decide to contest every castle.

I decided to tweak my original idea as I suspect that rather more scissor players will put at least one soldier into every castle than will put exactly 32 into one of 8, 9,  and 10.  I consider it unlikely that a scissor strategy would put more than 1 soldier into castles 2, 3, and 4, without also commuting similar or greater forces to castles 5, 6, and 7.  If he does that, it's not really a pure scissor, more a paper-scissors hybrid."

My feeling is that most of the analytical riddler minds will modify proportional distribution, giving slight edges to certain castles to try to win them by slight margins, as this seems like the optimal plan. So let's turn that on it's head, and beat a lot of people who smoothly allocate their points. 

There are 55 total points, so 23 total points win. There are many ways to get this with only three castles, but let's keep in mind people will tend to try to do sneaky things to steal high number castles (particularly #9, as that seems ""sneaky"" to ignore 10 and steal 9). 

My first reaction was: just win 7,8,9. Put all your points in and win those. This gives 24 and a sure win. But again, 9 seems like a very highly contested castle. So I decided instead, 6,7,8,2. Surely 2 and 6 should be more guaranteed than 9!

Now just how to distribute. Well, I should mirror how others will be distributing their points here. (obviously 25 troops to each could lose me 7,8 somewhat frequently). While it seems like I MUST win all four to win, many people will likely assign 0 to some castles, so tie points may come into effect. So even losing 6 can be repaired by a tie in 10 and 3.  So I aim to get 23 total points, so let's assign proportionally:

{0,2/23*100, 0,0,0,6/23*100, 7/23*100, 8/23*100, 0, 0} = {0,9,0,0,0,26,30,35,0,0}.

The total value of the castles is 55. The total victory points needed to win is 28, assuming no ties. The first thing to do is to establish the minimum number of ways to reach the winning number, given some assumptions and assessing potential strategies.  

I had to be careful that my strategy could not lose to an even distribution, and I assumed that everyone else would take the same precautions. Now, I wouldn't have to worry about other strategys that would lose to 10 troops at each castle, 20 trooops at 5 castles, etc. What I did need to worry about were more developed strategies like a bell distribution and whether or not people would put more than a third of their troops on one castle to secure a victory. 

Initially, I believed that giving up free castles was a poor strategy, so I started with the idea that a troop must be sent to each castle. That most players would send most of their troops to castle #10 was an assumption I kept. Assessing the average of winning #8 and #9 was as good as winning #7 and #10, I decided to lose the a few battles, and win the war. 

After many campaigns, I had a lot of rock/paper/scissors where one of my strategies would lose to one that didn't follow assumptions, but that one would lose to a more deliberate bell-curve or even spread.

So, we expect most strategies to rely on two or more of the top three castles plus two others (25,0,25,0,25,0,25,0,0,0). The available approaches to beat these baseline strategies are:
1) Claim two of those three with overwhelming strength and pick two more with sufficient strength to pick them up against token support (0,37,37,0,13,13,0,0,0,)
2) Figure that almost everyone wants to use either the 9-point castle or the 10-point castle and overload that, then spread the rest fairly widely expecting to pick up the holes in the opponent's broken strategy (1,51,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0)
3) Execute the strategy more or less directly, trying to claim three of the top four with strength, then choosing a fourth castle to claim with less than overwhelming support. (1,26,26,26,1,17,1,1,1,0)

Against (3), I'll need to win castles adding up to at least 15. I'll probably win 9 with all my spare troops there, so I need to pick more castles that add up to 6 or more and give them extra soldiers. I put 1+ceil(100N/28) troops in castles 3 and 4, leaving 1+ceil(100N/55) in castles 5 and 7.

Final results:
Castle 3: 1+ceil(100*3/28) = 12 soldiers
Castle 4: 1+ceil(100*4/28) = 16 soldiers
Castle 5: 1+ceil(100*5/55) = 11 soldiers
Castle 7: 1+ceil(100*5/55) = 14 soldiers

The remainder of the troops are concentrated on trying to win castle 3, rather than trying to win castle 7.

A ""wide"" strategy that contests all 10 castles (55 points, avg 1.81 men-per-point) will always lose to a ""tall"" strategy that contests barely enough castles to win (28 points, avg 3.57 men-per-point). With a nearly 2-to-1 advantage in men per point, the ""tall"" build has a lot of wiggle room for differences in castle distribution where it can still win.

A ""tall"" strategy will lose to a ""focused"" strategy that sends an unusual # of men to one or two castles (not enough to win by themselves) and then small #s of men to all remaining castles... but only if the ""focused"" player picks exactly the right castles. For example, a ""1-8-9-10"" tall player will lose to a focused-wide player that sends 54 men to castle 9 and 1 man-per-point to all other castles.

However, a ""focused"" build loses horribly to any ""wide"" build... and even to some ""tall"" builds. (for example, 9-focused versus 4-7-8-10 tall) Therefore, ""tall"" is the strongest overall strategy as it is only soft-countered by ""focused"".

When considering ""tall"" vs. ""tall"" fights... you're going to overlap on at least a few points. By definition if you win all of the overlap points, you'll have at least 28 victory points and you will win. So it is more important to contest the points you've chosen than to send single lonely soldiers to win uncontested points - you should go all-in on the limited # of castles you have.

Tall builds will be more likely to involve the higher numbers (8,9,10) than the lower numbers (you need all of castles 1-7 to win) so you should send greater-than-average men-per-point to the high numbers."

I then considered a value based model where each ith castle received (i/55)*100 troops so that 10 'value points' would be defended by the same number of troops whether they were all associated w/ one castle, or spread out among several. I used a monte carlo algorithm to benchmark both methods, testing each model against tens of thousands of randomized troop assignments. The value based model proved superior by a wide margin, but given how naive of a solution it was, I felt it wouldn't fare well against the majority of solutions. I noticed however that moving a single troop from the first castle to the tenth gave an assignment that beat this solution. This assignment however, could be outclassed in the same way. 

Thinking about the problem a little more, I realized only 28 points are needed to win, so I considered all or nothing strategies that heavily targeted just 4 castles with values adding up to 28. These solutions however, were the worst ones I'd come up w/ yet as losing just one of the 4 castles would guarantee failure against a typical assignment.

Intuitively, it was clear that 'clumping' was easily countered by more uniform troop distributions, but my benchmarking showed that the naive value-based model I came up with initially was worse than an augmented version of that model to a slight but statistically significant degree. Since the value based model was far better than the naive clumping approach, I decided to use that model as the basis for more monte carlo shenanigans. Starting w/ the value based model,
I generated random augmentations of a seed set of models . These augmented models differed by one to two troops assignments, and were benchmarked against randomized assignments like their predecessors. I would then collect the best models from one generation and use them as the seed set for the next generation. Eventually, I obtained a lot of models that look like the one I submitted, the submitted model being the best model in the last generation of assignments I produced. 

Looking back on my approach, I am optimistic about how this model would fare in competition. It looks a lot like the naive value based solution, but just a little bit better. I would hope my troop assignment would run into my value based solution a lot during the evaluation process, yet I have a few hangs ups. For one, I wonder if a clumping approach could work just by virtue of people playing fair. I imagine many people would submit well thought out solutions that might look a lot like my solution above. While my solution beats an estimated 95% of possible troop assignments, a clumping solution like [0,0,0,0,0,25,25,25,25,0] would beat my solution and others like it, while only beating an estimated 30% of solutions in general. Similarly, by benchmarking against random assignments, I may have included many extraneous strategies. Despite this, I don't feel fit to judge how motivated or clever other riddle enthusiasts are, so I'll stick to the result that took the longest to produce.

After getting that far in my thought process I couldn't decide what I should do, so I wrote a simple simulation to find interesting strategies for me. It randomly generates several thousands strategies and makes them fight in the same way you will be judging the contest. After that they are ranked by how many victories they achieved and then the losing half is removed and replaced by new strategies generated by randomly modifying ones in the winning half. This causes strategies to evolve over time. Strategies would rise up and start dominating the simulation then eventually be bested and move down to the losing half and disappear.
The strategy I chose was one that I hadn't though of but my simulation did, so I'm hoping not many other people will have thought of it.

My thinking has not changed all that much. I still think that a proportionate strategy is best but that it is also a good idea to aim for enough points to win, rather than all of the points. I also think that a strategy needs to be robust against similar strategies and to defeat all obvious strategies.

My concern, however, is that an opponent who anticipates the popularity of a proportionate strategy could exploit this by making their strategy slightly less proportionate, for example by overloading castle 10 at the expense of one of the other castles. This would defeat a proportionate strategy which targeted the same castles.

The best way to counter this is to not target castle 10 at all, and to let those smart alecs waste their resources.

Therefore, my strategy is now an almost-proportionate 28 point strategy, focusing on castles 4, 7, 8, 9. It is only non-proportionate to the extent that it takes 3 troops away from castle 4, and adds one to each of castles 7, 8 and 9.

I have done no computer simulations - this is all in my head - but as far as I can see, it will do very well against almost every opponent.

0,0,0,1,5,6,16,19,26,27,"Two things to note before going to the computation method. Firstly, the deployment 10-tuple should be weakly increasing; it makes no sense to devote more men to a less valuable castle. Secondly, there is no single deployment that beats all others. To see this, observe that (0, ..., 0, 100) is not best, as it is beaten by (0, ..., 0, 50, 50, 0). For any deployment other than (0, ..., 0, 100), take the first castle to be assigned a number of soldiers >0, and move one of them to the next (higher value) castle. This slightly modified deployment will win. [As the set of possible deployments is finite and ""beats or ties"" is 'total', we can see that ""beats or ties"" is not an ordering relation.]

This means that we're not trying to find (or approximate) the 'top' deployment, as there isn't one. Rather, we're trying to find the deployment that will beat the majority of submissions. As a first guess, let's randomly generate a bunch of (weakly increasing) deployments [more on that below], and see which ones beat the most of the other ones we generated. We might be tempted to just see which one gets the highest winning percentage and put that one in. But, we're not trying to get the highest winning percentage against random deployments, but rather against submitted deployments. So, we want to see which deployments work best against ""good candidates"" (assuming that's what people will submit).

We do this iteratively. Generate a whole bunch. Send the top half through to the next round. Then play that top half against each other, and send the top half of that round's competition through to the next round after that (irregardless of how well they did in the previous round; like Masterchef, unlike Hell's Kitchen, for any fellow Gordon Ramsey enthusiasts out there). At each iteration we get a better version of ""see how they do against 'good' candidates.""

My submission was the best after 10 rounds of this. I'm sure more rounds would give a better submission, but we'll see how this does.

Finally, the messy details about how I made random weakly increasing deployments.  I generated 10 random independent samplings of the Unif(0,1) distribution. I then scaled them all so as they summed to 100, rounded each of them down to the nearest integer, and added whatever I needed to the last sample to make them sum to 100.  Then, I sorted them, assigning the lowest integer to the least valuable castle, etc."

Strategy B is going all in on just 28 points worth of castles. Something like 40 on Castle 10, 28 on Castle 8, 19 on Castle 6, and 13 on Castle 4. There is little room for error with Strategy B, as losing just 1 of your targets guarantees a loss, but the big advantage here is that all soldiers are warring at the required castles and none are wasted.
I need to figure out a way to beat both of these strategies consistently ---- if I can, I figure I will win enough wars against these two to ignore any other strategies (strategies geared to beat these 2, strategies geared to beat mine, or other ""optimal if both are playing completely logically"" strategies I cannot come up with.) My first idea is to concede Castle 10, giving me more soldiers to play with in the rest of the 9 castles and hopefully proving to be a key advantage going forward. If I was to then proportion my soldiers out similar to Strategy A, but just on the back 9, I would clean up house against Strategy A. However, this will usually doom me against Strategy B. There are so many alterations of Strategy B: 10+9+8+1, 10+9+7+2, 10+9+6+3...39 different ones by my count. Moreover, each castle shows up in 19 to 20 of these different strategies.

Lastly, I chose my distribution of soldiers using a Price is Right-esque strategy, going just over multiples of 5 to hopefully avoid tying with the most common answers.

Also, looking at the distributions from last time, many people went with 0,1, or 2 troops at some relatively high value castles, so I set a minimum of 3 troops per castle to round up some cheap points- that fits with a strategy where you want to win a castle by having just one more troop than your opponent at a given castle.

So after sending a base one to each, I divided the 90/4 and determined that I should send 22 more troops to each of the four castles.Then I reasoned that Castle 6 was likely not going to as contested as the other three, so I took nine away from there and gave 7 to Castle 9 to make an even thirty. That gave me four more troops (two from the 6-9 distribution and two from the fact that 4 doesn't go into 90 cleanly).

This strategy is designed to narrowly defeat any small force at any castle, while focusing on castles 6 & 7 (usually ignored, but form a good base to combine with other towers) and increasing numbers of troops to castles 9 & 10.  Castle 8 is almost ignored, anticipating others will focus efforts there."

3,5,7,2,2,15,18,20,0,28,"The Name of this game should be 55. Why? Well for a similar reason why your website is called 538. 55 is the number of total points a player could win in this game, but 28 is the number of points a player needs to win, like 270 in an election. If a player can get to 28 points then he automatically wins. (Said player can win with less if there are ties). 

Instead of viewing the board as 55 points I can win, I view it as 28 points I need to win. That being said, each point is worth 3.57 of my soldiers (100/28). I am making an assumption, that most people will undervalue lower point tiers. Putting 3, 5, and 7 soldiers on tiers 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 15% of my soldiers, but gains 21% of the points needed. A major victory for my army. 

4 and 5 are tricky. They are needed to win if you go the 10,9,5,4 strategy (last season's winners did). But they were overcommitted to those areas. Being wary of losing them due to people overcommitting on them, I left them at 2. Every soldier needs someone to guard his back. Pick up the easy win vs those who bid 0 or 1, but don't lose out on those playing the 10,9,5,4 strategy. Probably a minor loss for my army. 

6,7,8 are much easier. They deserve 21, 25, and 28 soldiers respectively (using 3.57x *point value). But they are also VERY underappreciated by both past winners, and the average submission. Capitalizing on this, I can gain these points by using a decent amount of soldiers, but near the amount they deserve. Another major victory for my army. I can count on wins by using only 15, 18, and 20. 

This leaves me with 9 and 10. And 28 troops. If history tells us anything, its that people like castle 9 more than they like castle 10. This is an either or situation, you won't win both unless you overcommit. I place all 28 in castle 10.

I have chosen to fight hard for the 4 highest values, in hopes that most spread their troops more conservatively. Because Castle 7 is included in both of these combinations, it is likely to be highly contested, so I have placed a third of my troops there. 1 troop was distributed to all castles in the lower 6 to snag extra points in case of similar strategies, or to those which chose not to contest certain castles. This strategy only works if I am able to win all 4 top castles, so this beats the winning Feb 2017 strategy of aiming low, but not the Jun 2017 strategy of splitting between 9/10 and 4/5. That makes this strategy considerably more risky and dependent on what the general trends are among the other participants this time."

Additionally, if i win 8/9/10, only one other point is necessary, and the first castle has been historically poorly defended. I send my final troop to the second castle, because someone who has committed more than 5 troops to the first is probably less likely to have fortified the second."

I decided to make sure my strategy would defeat each of the past top 5 players.  I found a few combinations that worked and noticed that they had something in common:
brake the cores of the main strategies, but don't give up all the others in the process.
For some reason, 5 and 4 seem to be the most popular choices, so it seemed essential to steal one of these.  I chose 5 because it's worth more points.
The 2nd part is trickier, because now half the players go for 9 and 10, and the other half go for 8 and 7.  I decided to be bold in 10, dedicating far more troops than almost any of the other players would. Then, put enough of the remaining troops spread across the other three options.

Given that strategy, allocate soldiers in proportion to the castles' value. Specifically, targeted castles get 3x their value in numbers of soldiers while the remaining castles get half, rounded up. Given 100 soldiers, the specific numbers just sort of shook out that way.

Round 1 winners went strong for upper-middle and low numbers to get to 28 -- something like 8,7,5,4,3,1. In response, round 2 winners went strong specifically for 10, 9, 5, and 4. I'm countering those while still focusing on my primary strategy: try hard to get my primary targets to get to 28 points, while giving myself a chance on the other castles if I happen to lose one or two of my primary targets. Running against the previous 10 finalists I'd finish 9-1, and the one loss is 28-27, so mine may be a popular winning strategy as a counter to those, just as the leaders in previous iterations of the game used similar strategies to each other.

This means that my average opponent will aim to hold four castles, worth 28 victory points and will deploy 25 troops to each. 

There are (by my very quick, admittedly) count, 9 unique strategic combinations of four castles that get to the victory threshold. I assume that my opponents are indifferent about which one they choose and arrive at whichever one they wish to play randomly.

I use the frequency with which a castle worth a given number of victory points appears in one of the 9 unique four-castle strategies to generate the probability that my average opponent, within my simplifying assumptions, would place troops at that castle, and subsequently, how many soldiers (on average) I expect to be stationed at that castle. 

I would then simply distribute my 100 soldiers so I had marginally more at each castle than my opponent. Noting the inherent risk of this strategy (every battle should be a draw if my opponents play as I do, or as I expect them to give or take a trembling hand or two), I (rather randomly) decide that the castles worth 1 or 2 victory points are of low strategic value, given how infrequently they are included in 4-castle strategy and redistribute the six troops I would have placed there in the purer form of my strategy to the castles worth 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 and 5 VPs.

I then picked a combination of castles to focus on that if I won them, would give me 28 pts. I wanted to avoid #10 because I expect there will be a lot of fighting for that one, so I concentrated on 9, 7 and 5, to give me a good base of 21 pts. I then focused on the bottom 3 castles because I expect them to be lightly guarded. If I happen to ""steal"" a castle from someone since they put no one there, even better."

My draft distribution lost against those leaders, though, due to weakness in the 8-7-6 range.

To adjust, I reduced allocation to castle 9, redistributing those troops across castles 9-8-7-6, but left my highest concentrations at 10, 5, and 4.

 By all but abandoning 9 and 10, i should like take the other 8 castles in most scenarios mainly due to the fact that the enemy had no more troops to spend.

My goal with this deployment was not to beat the top performers - it was to beat the field. Beating the #1 warlord is the same as beating anyone else after all.

I decided on this strategy by coming up with several theories on how to win, and testing them against an approximation of “the field” I created using the data provided by the previous contests and a Gaussian number generator. 333 “participants” were based off of the data from the first contest, 666 from the second, each of the top 5 strategies got 15 entries, and to make it an even 1150 the last participant placed 10’s in each castle.

Hopefully there aren’t too many people who copy-paste the winning lists, otherwise I’ll lose! While I calculated a roughly 70-75% win chance in total vs the field, and a solid 80% win chance vs the initial top 5, I literally lose to each of the most recent top 5. So... good luck to me?

If I win a large castle narrowly, this is the best scenario, but an overwhelming loss is also acceptable (since it will cost my opponent many troops to achieve this, and therefore give me numerical superiority elsewhere). It's like the electoral college!

In the previous rounds, players deployed troop amounts on the large castles that were either very small or very large. My strategy depends on my expectation that this pattern will repeat itself. I chose all of my troop placements with this in mind, determined not to lose any large castle narrowly against either of those strategies.

I invested heavily into castles 9 and 10, expecting to win their points almost every time. If I win one or both of them narrowly, then this is a significant boon to my efficiency. If I win them overwhelmingly, this is not as good, but for 19 points I'm willing to take the risk. I expect to defeat most players who conduct a predictable attack on one or both of these castles. If I lose either of these castles after such a large investment then I probably lose the match.

I expect to do well in castles 3, 6, 7, and 8. I'm vulnerable to opponents who attack three or more of these simultaneously with medium-sized forces while conceding castles 9 and 10, as some top finishers did in the first round, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. Any two of these mid-range castles, plus the 19 points above will give me the 28 points necessary for the win.

Castles 4 and 5 seem to have been highly overvalued in the earlier rounds, so I did not contest them at all. I am hoping to take an overwhelming loss here against opponents who try this again. If I lose them narrowly, that's unfortunate, but it won't matter too much. My path to 28 points is fairly difficult to block even without them."

Then I repeated this whole thing 99 more times to get 500 top of the top players. 

From these 500 top of the top players, I calculated the median placements for each battlefield. 

Then I repeated the above until I had a 10 medians for each battlefield. I took the mean of each battlefields medians and used the 10 means to calculate my strategy. 

I begin by allocating 1 soldier to each battlefield and set this as my starting configuration. Then I calculated the points per median soldier allocation for each battlefield. This would give me a way to rank which battlefields should be allocated to first. 

Going according to the highest points per median soldier allocation battlefield, I added to the battlefield the floor of the respective battlefields mean of medians. I went down the rankings until I ran out of soldiers or finished allocating to the last battlefield.

The way to beat this could be either increase my 6-7-8 numbers or pick up points from elsewhere from that person. I decided that playing for the 9 might be a good idea. The 9 was really expensive last time, but it was enabled to do so by the low 6-7-8 numbers. I'm assuming that this person is beating some or all of my 6-7-8, so they can't shove on the 9 as well. I've fairly arbitrarily decided 26 on the 9. This leaves me 16. First, I'm putting at least 1 on each of the first 5 to punish any 0s. Now I have 11. I might want to put everything on 5, and that would be strong against people who were playing around the previous set where 5 was a huge spike for no reason, but the 5 could easily be a huge spike again for no reason so I don't want to put much into it.

Not only did all the top deployments from round 2 follow that strategy, but deployments optimized against the first two rounds' results (and deployments optimized against optimized deployments!) follow it also, sometimes even more strongly. That has left me perfectly torn between two opposite approaches - take the obvious lesson, invest heavily in 4 castles and try to win that way (which would mean a deployment like 0-0-11-0-0-23-1-2-36-27); or assume that everybody will try 4-castle approaches now, and optimize against them while still scoring decently against other plans. I've changed my mind about a dozen times, and finally decided to do the latter. I'm tackling the 4-castlers head-on in castles 3, 6 and 9 (a 4-castle plan needs to go through at least one of those), and putting more than just a token presence in castles 7, 8 and 10 because simulations. The problem is that unlike the 4-castle approach, which is essentially dumb-plan-proof, my approach loses to simple deployments like 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-17-19 or even the dreaded ""put ten guys in every castle and pray""; and because my presence in castle 3 isn't that great I'm somewhat vulnerable to a 10-8-7-3 plan too. But the advantage is that fewer people will likely try this approach than the 4-castle one; even if the 4-castle approach turned out to be the winning approach in general, there's no guarantee that I personally would win; whereas if this is the basic winning approach, my chances of winning or placing high should be good. Essentially, I'm gambling that not too many people will submit really simple and obvious deployments."

I added focus to enough midlevel castles to generate a minimal winning score of 28 (Castles 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 = 28). That took up 84 troops total for focus areas. Near the bottom I was highly economical, figuring zero troops at Castle 1 and one troop at Castle 2, which I figure will win me an occasional half point and even an infrequent point.

I recommend, after the main contest's round robin, you try scoring it a different way: a series of round robins for which only the top teams survive; keeping only the first 2^n teams (n being the largest number such that 2^n is smaller than the number of entrants) and keeping half after each successive round robin.

I further narrowed it down based on which involved the fewest castles.  Of the 40 solutions, 9 required focusing on 4 castles. From here on it becomes judgment calls.
The last warlords competition saw 4 of the top 5 winners with the combination 10,9,5,4 (also employing the 28 point strategy). I’m unsure of whether this means we will see more or less of this particular combination, however 7 of the 9 found before use castle 10 and 6 use castle 9.  I decided to go with 3 heavy hitters in 8,9,10 so that I could spend less on my 4th castle in castle 1.
On choosing the amounts, the first warlords page provided some very useful information on the underlying statistics of the distribution. I noticed this was missing from the next time, so I made some inferences. We see the skewed distribution for just about all 10 castles, so the median should nearly always be lower than the mean – and in this case significantly so. So choosing the amounts for castles 8,9, and 10 I based off the mean (and previous winners for an approximate upper range) to establish a point where my guess would be safely in the 90%ile or higher for each.
For the remainder of castles, I feel leaving them empty is unwise – as most of the time my selections for 1,8,9, and 10 should all win against normal opponent selections – for castles 2 through 7 I was debating leaving anywhere from 1 to 3 to defend.  I landed on 1 in the interest of increasing defense for my primary 4, but so that in the fringe case that somebody defeats one of my castles I have a chance to gain points back if they leave something undefended.

0.1,5.1,0.1,0.1,17.1,22.1,25.1,1.1,6.1,23.1,"A few guiding observations: 
-The champion sets of the other two had about an 80% win rate. That seems like a good target for this time.
-The champion set from the second iteration would have done well on the first. It makes sense to make something that would have done well in the others.
-The champion set from the first iteration would have gotten obliterated in the second. It's a good idea not to repeat either of the champions.
-The top sets from the first iteration prioritized 8, 7, 5 and at least one of 6 and 4.
-The top sets from the second iteration prioritized 10, 9, 5, and 4.
-That one person had fractional troops in the second iteration. That seems good and reduces the need to consider draws. Also, that allows one to overshoot a target by a smaller degree, freeing up backups for less-guarded castles.

I found the 80th percentile number for each castle from each iteration. I then took the higher of these 80th percentilers of the two iterations and created the set (4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 21, 25, 31, 29, 23). I then treated that as a single entry and found roughly the cheapest way to beat it to 28 points--targeting 10, 7, 6, and 5. I was able to cover these with 85.4 troops. Of course, if I target only those, I have to win every single one of them, or I lose. For that reason, I chose to post a small contingency in 9 and 2 (which will cover me in the case that I lose either 10 or both 6 and 5...  2 had a significantly lower barrier than 3/4, and 9 was somehow softer than 8). I then gave 0.1 troops to 1, 3 and 4 to ensure I outright win any undefended castles. Castle 8 seemed weird to do just 0.1 for, so I threw 1.1 there. Then, adding one more troop to 6 and 7 seemed to have a very good ROI for the other two iterations, so I went ahead and did that.

Final stray observations: I wish I had marked my other two entries in such a way that I could identify them easily. I feel like this one will stand out in the data a lot better (though I suspect a few others will utilize decimal troops as well)."

Castles 5 (main counter to round two strategies), 7 (main counter to round one strategies), and 8 (some round one strategies) can break a lot of opponent strategies so contesting them is where my main investment took place.  It is a bit of a gamble to pick up stray points in low commit castles when my other investments aren't high enough to offset opponent high commits."
